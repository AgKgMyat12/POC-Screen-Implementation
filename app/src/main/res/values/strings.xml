    <string name="dummy_storyline">Thor: Ragnarok delivers a frankly shocking ending that leaves the Thor trilogy on a very unexpected, somber yet redemptive note and sets an interesting stage for the God of Thunder going forward. </string>
    <string name="title_review"><u>Review</u></string>
    <string name="review">I wouldn’t have picked Chris Hemsworth as Marvel\'s breakout comedy star when he was first cast as Thor, God of Thunder, but he turned out to be one of the best things about this never-ending mega-franchise. He’s tall, brawny and impossibly handsome, but there’s a self-mocking twinkle in his eye. When Thor is in gung-ho jock mode, Hemsworth’s wry machismo evokes the young Sean Connery as James Bond, raising an eyebrow at the corniness around him. When he bumbles and stumbles, there’s a touch of Cary Grant to his embarrassment. And when he’s playing things more or less straight, there’s an average guyness to his reactions. All this humanizes an actor who’s perpetually at risk of being treated as a life-sized action figure.</string>
